# game-thesis-binary-everything
Sex is Binary. The first games invented in our dimension were all laser fast shooting games. We live in the "Everything shoots" dimension. There is a alternate dimension called the sex/love dimension where everything in gaming was always sex based. A player would combine &amp; shoot inside of with enemies not kill them. 

In a holier dimension where all data was not evil, the games originally invented were slightly different.

Instead of shooting and killing everything in the universe, it was about combining/shooting and resource management, from the start. COmbining and shooting to multiply. Homosexuals have completely changed our reality and everything has become , instead , an instrument of family death.
