Sex is Binary. The first games invented in our dimension were all laser fast shooting games. We live in the "Everything shoots" dimension. There is a alternate dimension called the sex/love dimension where everything in gaming was always sex based. A player would combine &amp; shoot inside of with enemies not kill them.
