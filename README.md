# game-thesis-binary-everything
Sex is Binary. The first games invented in our dimension were all laser fast shooting games. We live in the "Everything shoots" dimension. There is an alternate dimension called the sex/love dimension where everything in gaming was always sex based, it is a holier place where there is no evil. A player would combine &amp; shoot inside-of with enemies, not kill them. 

In a holier dimension where all data was not evil, the games originally invented were slightly different.

Instead of shooting and killing everything in the universe, it was about combining/shooting and resource management, from the start. COmbining and shooting to multiply. Homosexuals have completely changed our reality and everything has become , instead , an instrument of family death.

Games and The Death Of The Family

Kill everything. Kill the hookers, then steal their money. THen steal a car and go kill someone for some more money. Or kill demons. Or kill Nazis. Or Germans and Japanese characters. Shoot them. Stomp on their heads too. 

The Return of Sex

Mario "World" UPDATE Verion 99
1. sex is binary
2. you cannot kill enemies anymore as Mario
3. you are a LOVER now, not a KILLER
4. you can avoid enemies OR you have sex with each enemy and turn them into your army
5. multiple new meters and bars for health and resource stealing from enemies as you have binary sex with each enemy
6. you are going to LOVE your enemy

This is the LOVE MARIO (15 Luigi) version of the new 'game system'.

Mario is the new introduction character to the new system in gaming. His style is interesting.

Mario in this initial version is a lover. He is not homosexual with Luigi. Luigi is not a playable character in Super Mario Bros. (Luigi is not playable yet).

Mario is still attempting to rescue the Mushroom Princess and mate with her. How many people you convert or have sex with will change the endings of the games.

This is the new unofficial episode in the Mario & Luigi Brothers, Bowser & Koopas, and the Mushroom Princess Franchice.

Mario as a Prototype for ALL Games
---
1. Take Mario game player hero as prototype.
2. He cannot kill enemies anymore.
3. He has a pumping power now.
4. Pumping power explained: 1. he can have sex with it by just moving the pixels into it and away from the target enemies when you are close enough. The vibration will cause the enemy to change. 2. a harpoon connects with enemies instead of sex and creates a wave that changes the enemies. 3. You can pump an enemy with a wave and eventually you can sap the enemy of all their actual virabtion. 4. enemies are changed by vibration, bullets are like vibration and oscillation, this is similar.

Sap an enemy and move on to the next level
---
You progress by avoiding enemies or sapping them of their life by humping them or sending waves to them.

At the end of the elvels you raise the flag and progress onto the next level all the same.

Love will prevail, There is no more Death in gaming
---
enemies just walk around like normal. They are sapped of their enery and then just behave normal and do not attack you any more. Enemies walk through you after you sap them.
